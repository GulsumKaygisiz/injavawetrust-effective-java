	// ####
	// Item 20 : Prefer interfaces to abstract classes
	// Java has two mechanism to define a type that permits multiple implementations
	// : interfaces and abstract classes.
	// Since the introduction of default methods for interfaces in Java8 , both
	// mechanisms allow you to prodcide implementations for some instance methods.
	// A major difference is that to implement the type defined by an abstract class
	// ,a class must be a subclass of the abstract class.
	
	// ####
	// Existing classes can easily be retrofitted to implement a new interface
