	// #####
	// Item 56: Write doc comments for all exposed API elements

	// If an API is to be usable, it must be documented. Traditionally, API
	// documentation was generated manually, and keeping it in sync with code was a
	// chore

	// Javadoc generates API documentation automatically from source code with
	// specially formatted documentation comments, more commonly known as doc
	// comments.

	// While the doc comment conventions are not officially part of the language,
	// they constitute a de facto API that every Java programmer should know.

	// One important doc tag was added in Java 9, {@index}; one in Java 8,
	// {@implSpec}; and two in Java 5, {@literal} and {@code}. These tags are
	// missing from the aforementioned web page, but are discussed in this item.

	// To document your API properly, you must precede every exported class,
	// interface, constructor, method, and field declaration with a doc comment.

	// The doc comment for a method should describe succinctly the contract between
	// the method and its client.
