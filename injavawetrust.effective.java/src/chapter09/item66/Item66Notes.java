	// Item 66: Use native methods judiciously

	/*
	 * The Java Native Interface (JNI) allows Java programs to call native methods,
	 * which are methods written in native programming languages such as C or C++.
	 */

	// Historically, native methods have had three main uses.
	// - They provide access to platform-specific facilities such as registries.
	// - They provide access to existing libraries of native code, including legacy
	// libraries that provide access to legacy data
	// - Finally, native methods are used to write performance-critical parts of
	// applications in native languages for improved performance.
