	// Chapter 11
	// THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently. Concurrent
	// programming is harder than single-threaded programming, because more things
	// can go wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce. You canâ€™t avoid
	// concurrency. It is inherent in the platform and a requirement if you are to
	// obtain good performance from multicore processors, which are now ubiquitous.
	// This chapter contains advice to help you write clear, correct, well
	// documented concurrent programs.

	// #####
	// Item 78: Synchronize access to shared mutable data

	// The synchronized keyword ensures that only a single thread can execute a
	// method or block at one time.
